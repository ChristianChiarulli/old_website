## General Setings

To include some basics in your config first create a directory called general and a file called `settings.vim`

```
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/general

touch ~/.config/nvim/general/settings.vim
```

Here is every general setting I use with a brief explanation:

Add the following to settings.vim

```
" set leader key
let g:mapleader = "\<Space>"

syntax enable                           " Enables syntax highlighing
set hidden                              " Required to keep multiple buffers open multiple buffers
set nowrap                              " Display long lines as just one line
set encoding=utf-8                      " The encoding displayed
set pumheight=10                        " Makes popup menu smaller
set fileencoding=utf-8                  " The encoding written to file
set ruler              			            " Show the cursor position all the time
set cmdheight=2                         " More space for displaying messages
set iskeyword+=-                      	" treat dash separated words as a word text object"
set mouse=a                             " Enable your mouse
set splitbelow                          " Horizontal splits will automatically be below
set splitright                          " Vertical splits will automatically be to the right
set t_Co=256                            " Support 256 colors
set conceallevel=0                      " So that I can see `` in markdown files
set tabstop=2                           " Insert 2 spaces for a tab
set shiftwidth=2                        " Change the number of space characters inserted for indentation
set smarttab                            " Makes tabbing smarter will realize you have 2 vs 4
set expandtab                           " Converts tabs to spaces
set smartindent                         " Makes indenting smart
set autoindent                          " Good auto indent
set laststatus=0                        " Always display the status line
set number                              " Line numbers
set cursorline                          " Enable highlighting of the current line
set background=dark                     " tell vim what the background color looks like
set showtabline=2                       " Always show tabs
set noshowmode                          " We don't need to see things like -- INSERT -- anymore
set nobackup                            " This is recommended by coc
set nowritebackup                       " This is recommended by coc
set updatetime=300                      " Faster completion
set timeoutlen=500                      " By default timeoutlen is 1000 ms
set formatoptions-=cro                  " Stop newline continution of comments
set clipboard=unnamedplus               " Copy paste between vim and everything else
"set autochdir                           " Your working directory will always be the same as your working directory

au! BufWritePost $MYVIMRC source %      " auto source when writing to init.vm alternatively you can run :source $MYVIMRC

" You can't stop me
cmap w!! w !sudo tee %
```

Source in init.vim

```
source $HOME/.config/nvim/general/settings.vim
```

## Mapping new keys

Again we'll create a directory called keys and and a file called mappings.vim

```
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/keys

touch ~/.config/nvim/keys/mappings.vim
```

Add the following to mappings.vim:

```
" Better nav for omnicomplete
inoremap <expr> <c-j> ("\<C-n>")
inoremap <expr> <c-k> ("\<C-p>")

" Use alt + hjkl to resize windows
nnoremap <M-j>    :resize -2<CR>
nnoremap <M-k>    :resize +2<CR>
nnoremap <M-h>    :vertical resize -2<CR>
nnoremap <M-l>    :vertical resize +2<CR>

" I hate escape more than anything else
inoremap jk <Esc>
inoremap kj <Esc>

" Easy CAPS
inoremap <c-u> <ESC>viwUi
nnoremap <c-u> viwU<Esc>

" TAB in general mode will move to text buffer
nnoremap <TAB> :bnext<CR>
" SHIFT-TAB will go back
nnoremap <S-TAB> :bprevious<CR>

" Alternate way to save
nnoremap <C-s> :w<CR>
" Alternate way to quit
nnoremap <C-Q> :wq!<CR>
" Use control-c instead of escape
nnoremap <C-c> <Esc>
" <TAB>: completion.
inoremap <expr><TAB> pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<TAB>"

" Better tabbing
vnoremap < <gv
vnoremap > >gv

" Better window navigation
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l

nnoremap <Leader>o o<Esc>^Da
nnoremap <Leader>O O<Esc>^Da
```

Source in init.vim

```
source $HOME/.config/nvim/keys/mappings.vim
```

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```

You'll probably notice you don't have support for copy/paste also that python and node haven't been setup

So let's fix that

First we'll fix copy/paste

- On mac `pbcopy` should be builtin

- On Ubuntu

  ```
  sudo apt install xsel
  ```

- On Arch Linux

  ```
  sudo pacman -S xsel
  ```

Next we need to install python support (node is optional)

- Neovim python support

  ```
  pip install pynvim
  ```

- Neovim node support

  ```
  npm i -g neovim
  ```

### Note

If you use virtual environments I highly suggest putting these varibles in your config

I recommend putting this in paths.vim in the general directory

```
let g:python3_host_prog = expand("<path to python with pynvim installed>")
let g:python3_host_prog = expand("~/.miniconda/envs/neovim/bin/python3.8") " <- example

let g:node_host_prog = expand("<path to node with neovim installed>")
let g:node_host_prog = expand("~/.nvm/versions/node/v12.16.1/bin/node") " <- example
```

Run `checkhealth` again and you should now see the requirements are met
