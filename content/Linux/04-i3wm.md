## Packages we will need

- i3wm

  ```
  sudo pacman -S i3-gaps i3status i3lock dmenu    # Arch

  sudo apt install i3-gaps i3status i3lock dmenu    # Ubuntu
  ```

- terminal

  ```
  sudo pacman -S alacritty

  sudo apt install alacritty
  ```

- X utilities

  ```
  sudo pacman -S xorg-xset xorg-xrandr   # Arch

  sudo apt install xorg-xset xorg-xrandr   # Ubuntu
  ```

- autotiling

  ```
  yay -S autotiling   # AUR only
  ```

### Note

If you want autotiling on Ubuntu or another distro head over to there github and grab the python file

[autotiling](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/autotiling)

## Config

Put this stuff in your `.xprofile`

```
# Stop screen from going blank
xset s off
xset -dpms
xset s noblank
# Faster key repeat and delay
xset r rate 210 40
```

I recommend pulling down my config to get started

```
git clone https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

We can grab some of my config like this:

```
mv ~/.config/i3/config ~/.config/i3/config.old

mv ~/dotfiles/.config/i3/config ~/.config/i3/config

mkdir ~/.config/alacritty

mv ~/dotfiles/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml
```

## Add status bar

```
bar {
  position top
  status_command i3status
}
```

## Commands

For a list of all your commands open the `~/.config/i3/config` file and look under each character to see what they do

## Extending i3

You can checkout the `i3ipc` library for python if you're interested

## Why use i3wm instead of any other?

I use i3wm because it was the first WM I was introduced to. I'm sure the other ones are great too.

It also has a very big community and lots of documentation.

Some other options to consider are:

- dwm
- xmonad
- bspwm
- awesome
- spectrwm
