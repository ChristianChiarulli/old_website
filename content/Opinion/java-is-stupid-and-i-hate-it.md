- Oracle makes my life more difficult than it needs to be

- The level of ceremony and boilerplate is out of control (Use Lombok!)

* Spring was such a complicated framework that it needed a framework on top called Spring Boot and even that is kind of a pain so Spring Initializr (which is spelled dumb) has to exist

* Also Annotations are too magical in Spring

* I always have difficulty finding documentation that is either:
  - A. Complete
  - B. Relevant and updated

- Maven and Gradle are a pain in the ass (also many teams use both which just adds to the complexity)

- Which leads me to the fact that there is still no modern (usable) package manager

- The mascot is dumb and idk what it's supposed to be
