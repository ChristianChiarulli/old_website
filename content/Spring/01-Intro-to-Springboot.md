Code can be found [here](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/SpringBootIntro)

This is a spring boot application which provides REST endpoints to perform CRUD operations on topics and related courses

The project comes with a wrapper for Maven `mvnw`

to create the `jar` simply run the following:

```
./mvnw clean package
```

To start the application run the following:

```
java -jar target/filename.jar
```

This will start a tomcat server on port 8080

It will also start actuator on port 9001

And you can use a tool like Postman to make requests.

We are also using an embedded database Apache Derby

## Requests

This project handles GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests for topics and their courses

Here are a few example calls you can make:

### Topic CRUD operations

- get all

```
http://localhost:8080/topics
```

- get particular topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}
```

- post topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics
```

body:

```
{
  "id": "java",
  "name": "Java",
  "description": "Java description"
}
```

- put topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}
```

make sure you pass an updated body

- delete topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}
```

### Course CRUD operations

- get all

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}/courses
```

- get particular topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}/courses/{id}
```

- post topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}/courses
```

body:

```
{
  "id": "java-spring",
  "name": "Java Spring",
  "description": "Java Spring description"
}
```

- put topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}/courses/{id}
```

make sure you pass an updated body

- delete topic

```
http://localhost:8080/topics/{topicId}/courses/{id}
```

## To view Actuator

```
http://localhost:9001/actuator/health
```
