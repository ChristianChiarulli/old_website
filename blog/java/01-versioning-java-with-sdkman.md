## What is SDKMAN?

SDKMAN! is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits. This is very useful for managing Java versions as well as Gradle, Maven etc..

## Installation

Open up a terminal and enter:

```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

This will add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```

export SDKMAN_DIR="/home/chris/.sdkman"
[[ -s "/home/chris/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" ]] && source "/home/chris/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Now you can open a new terminal and run the following to confirm installation:

```
sdk version
```
